* The Web Is Built On The Internet :slide:

* We Use These Phrases :slide:
  + "Connects to server"
  + "Sends response to client"
  + "Closes the connection"
What do they mean?

* Internet Architecture is Composable :slide:two_col:
[[file:img/composable_inception.jpg]]
  + Emphasize flexibility
  + Allow for growth, incremental adoption
  + Interchangeable parts

* Two Computers Need to Communicate :slide:
  + String a wire between them
  + Send bits across
  + Wait for response?
** Imagine :notes:
   + A time before the Internet and Web
   + Wire could be connected in anyway
   + Bit could be sent in anyway
   + Other computer may respond, may not

* Three Computers Need to Communicate :slide:
Get more wire

[[file:img/3c-communication.png]]
** Wires :notes:
   + Multiple wires between computers?
     + One sending, one receiving?
   + Each computer hooked up to every other, no message passing
   + Mostly workable
   + Disadvantage: what happens when you want to connect another computer?

* Circuit Switching :slide:two_col:
  + New computer joins network: wire it up
  + Switch the electronic circuit
  [[file:img/telephone-operators.jpg]]
** Electronic circuits :notes:
   + Very similar to phone "networks": wire up the two parties
   + Doesn't scale well, but can be fine for small networks
   + Computers better when multiple can communicate: conference line

* Network :slide:two_col:
[[file:img/3c-communication.png]]
  + Now we have a network
  + Mostly computer-to-computer
  + How to we communicate between networks?
** Problems :notes:
   + Can't put whole world on same medium
   + Composability: allow different LAN to work independently
   + Need some way to address computers that is independent from local network

* ARPANET :: Network :slide:two_col:
  + Circuit Switching -> Packet Switching
  + Relied on Interface Message Processors (IMPs)
  + Government, no commercial traffic
[[file:img/Leonard-Kleinrock-and-IMP1.png]]
** Details :notes:
   + First pass: academic inter-network
   + Instead of connecting on same medium, use packets that were routed to a
     destination with IMPs
   + Installation planned at 9 months
   + Speed 50 kbit/second (home cable is 245x faster)
     + loading yelp.com would take ~19 seconds
     + but wouldn't have fit into memory
   + IMPs were early routers, but more complexity: added reliable routing

* Packet Switching :slide:two_col:
  + Send small packets of information
  + Addressed to a receiver
  + Can share medium
  [[file:img/pony-express.jpg]]
** Postal :notes:
   + More similar to post mail than circuit switched telephones:
   + Address a small packet/letter to a person/address
   + All mail handled by the same middle layer

* Trade-offs :slide:
  + Big, expensive IMPs required
  + Connection to LAN up to owners
  + Couldn't handle multiple connections
** Communication :notes:
   + Can't rely on the sophistication of the carrier network
   + Can't all be carrying around IMPs
   + But we'd still like to send packets of data over some link
   + IMPs only expected networks to talk to each other, not applications on
     specific hosts
   + So next iteration designed to solve these problems

* Internet Protocol :slide:
  + Moves much responsibility to host software
  + Keeps packet switching and routing
  + Adds concept of ports*
** End-to-end :notes:
   + End-to-end principle: application-specific functionality must reside on
     end-hosts, because they know exactly what is required
   + Many of the limitations of ARPANET were not able to be composed with new
     solution because all of the logic was in the big iron
   + Packet switching was a great idea.
   + Ports added in TCP/UDP layer

* Internet Protocol :slide:
  + Where is the destination? (host addressing)
  + How do I get there? (routing)
  + Stateless!
** IP :notes:
   + Simplify: tease apart central concepts to implement composability
   + Best effort delivery: send it off and hope for the best
   + Don't even guarantee we got the same data!
   + Very simple, but flexible enough to build on top of
   + But one of the first things stipulated about the Web was we either
     expect the data to show up, or see an error. How does that happen?

* Packets travel over networks :slide:two_col:
  + Packets sent to Yelp from ischool
  + Destination is specified with a number (IP address)
  + Routing is done by forwarding to the next best network
[[file:img/ip-communication.png]]
** Routing Details :notes:
   + We want to send data to Yelp. But where is Yelp?
   + Happens to be in SF, but what if it moves?
   + Networks hand off to the next network it thinks is "closer" to Yelp
   + That network hands it off... etc.
   + Until we get to Yelp
   + Lots of problems can happen:
     + No route to host
     + It can go different ways

* IP Address :slide:
  + Numbers, often represented as "dotted decimal" (199.255.189.160)
  + But can also be represented as just a number (3355426208)
  + IPs assigned by Internet Assigned Numbers Authority
** IPv4 notation :notes:
   + "IP" short for "IP Address"
   + "dotted quads"
   + IP version 4 : 32 bit, IPv6 : 128 bit
   + IANA typically assigns ranges, then delegated out
   + ischool gets an IP from a range assigned to Berkeley, which has a range
     assigned to UC system (example)

* Routing :slide:
  + Border Gateway Protocol tracks routes to IPs
  + ISPs manually configure peers to share information
  + Routers use BGP to forward packets
** More information :notes:
   + Routing and peering big topics, please follow up with a networking class if
     you're interested
   + Take-away: networks can communicate with each other even if not directly
     connected: packets are forwarded along

* Ethernet :slide:two_col:
  + All computers on the same physical medium
  + "Frames" addressed to a receiver
  + Interruptions happen with re-tries
  [[file:img/http-stack.gif]]
** Trade-offs :notes:
   + Don't have to wire new computers up with separate cables
   + Still have to wire computers on the same physical line
   + All computer recieve all messages -- just choose to ignore the ones not for
     it
   + Implications about security, bandwidth
   + Ethernet just one type of LAN, now dominate
